# image-optimizer

image optimizer - this is a nodejs script built to take a wp-content/upload folder from a WordPress site and make all of the images a smaller size for the web.

## Pre-requisites:
1.) Take your wp-content/uploads folder and dump it into the uploads directory in this application.

2.) You will need to take the images that get generated in the optimized folder and copy it back into your wp-content/uploads folder on your WordPRess website. Make sure you keep backups of both folders somewhere else just in case something goes wrong.

### How to Run the Project

1.) Git clone Repo

2.) `npm install` or you can do this instead `npm i` and make sure to do it in the root of the repo.

3.) `npm run start`
